# pomodoro-timer

## General Program Description

This is a pomodoro timer with two modes: personal and traditional. It also contains several audio files for which the user can select a specific
alarm sound they desire.

### Traditional Pomodoro

The traditional pomodoro works as a normal pomodoro would: the user determines the length of their breaks and study intervals and inputs a sequence 
into terminal.

### Personal Pomodoro
The personal pomodoro mode came from an idea I had of creating a pomodoro timer catered to one's attention span, 
as some people can work for 40 minutes without losing focus, and other 25 minutes. So Instead of having them trial and error how long they
think they can work without losing focus by selecting random times, the user simply just works until they lose focus and enters something 
into terminal to log the time, which will be printed at the end of their study session.
